Meal App
The Meals Application works like so:

Main categories and meals are stored in local storage, meals can be in multiple categories. 
User can navigate using the drawer or clicking category tiles or meals to go into more details. 
User can add their personal meals using the meal form.
Meals that are added are stored in a database and accessed seperately from the meals already in the app.
Personal meals are shown uniquely and can be deleted by simply tapping the meal tile itself and deleting it.
User is given the chance to mark meals as their favourite by tapping on the star icon in the top-right of the meal.
Favourited meals are shown in the Favorites tab. Similarly they can be unfavourited by tapping the star icon again.
